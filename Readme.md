Some experiments with machine learning to play games. Currently just Tic-Tac-Toe.

TODO
====

- abstract out input (double[]) and output from neural networks
- implement mutation in neural net architecture
- write some goddamn tests before everything breaks.. JUnit or something?
- implement trainers, training policies

ASPIRATIONAL
------------

- experiment with neural net sizes & architectures, or allow mutation
- implement other TBS games
- implement realtime game

IDEAS
-----

- multi-neural-net learner, has multiple neural nets to represent different "questions" (with different network sizes), more complicated games
